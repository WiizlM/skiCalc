SkiCalc is a web application specifically for ski jumpers.

Ski length of a jumper depends on his/her BMI which is calculated and stored in an Excel file deep down in FIS homepage.
Finding your height and value needed might be quite tedious.

To make the process way faster and easier i made this little app.
It uses the same formula as official document.

Application takes an input value of athletes height and calculates results.
Left numbers are ski lengths and right ones are weight neended for the specific ski length.
